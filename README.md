To put in new reactions:

Create a new folder, and name it the next available integer in the "Reactions" folder.

Use Chemdraw to draw out the starting material, product, and each of the intermediates and individually save them as png files
    Names of files should be sm.png, product.png, int0.png, int1.png, and int2.png

Draw out the conditions and fit them into the reagents box (adjust your font size and do NOT resize the box!)
Save the reagents in the "Reagents" folder and name them with the following syntax: rxnx_y; where x is the reaction number and y is the index of the reagents


Things that need to be worked on:
Adding more problems!
